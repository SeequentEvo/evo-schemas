# unstructured-quad-grid

<SchemaUri uri="schema/objects/unstructured-quad-grid/1.3.0/unstructured-quad-grid.schema.json" />

Represents an unstructured grid where cells are quadrilaterals.

The grid implements spatial properties including a coordinate reference system and bounding box in world coordinates.

The grid's data are all stored on the `quadrilaterals` attribute, which defines the spatial layout of the grid, including the coordinates of the vertices and the connectivity between them to form quadrilateral cells.
