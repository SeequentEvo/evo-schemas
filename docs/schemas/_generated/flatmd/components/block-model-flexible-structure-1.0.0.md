### block-model-flexible-structure (v1.0.0)
The structure of a flexibly-subblocked block model. Subblocking is carried out by dividing each parent block into a fixed grid of subblocks defined by n_subblocks_per_parent, before recombining the subblocks into larger chunks. The resulting subblocks can have different sizes within the same parent block, but must remain cuboid and completely fill the parent block.
