<SchemaUri uri="schema/components/resistivity-ip-line/1.1.0/resistivity-ip-line.schema.json" />

The `resistivity-ip-line` component represents a single line of resistivity-IP survey data, including
electrode positions, measurements, and associated attributes. Each line corresponds to one acquisition
profile and contains the spatial layout of electrodes along with the measured apparent resistivity
and IP data.
