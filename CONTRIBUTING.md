# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Seequent software. Everyone is welcome to contribute to our software!
There are many ways you can contribute. This document provides a summary of some of these ways.

## Asking a question

If you have a question about how the code in this library works, or would like to propose a change, feel free to
open a new issue on GitHub.

If you have a general question, head over to [Seequent Community](https://community.seequent.com/group/19-evo).

## Reporting bugs/issues

Bug reports and feature requests are welcomed in the form of GitHub issues.

You can search existing issues to see if others have already reported your issue. If you find something relevant, you
can react to it using a üëç or üëé emoji. Please avoid "+1" or "me too" style comments on the issue without providing
further context or helpful information.

If you can't find an existing issue that represents your request, open a new issue. When opening issues, ensure you
provide a clear description of the problem or idea, along with any necessary context (software version, operating
system, example code, steps to reproduce, etc.). We also welcome pull requests to fix bugs instead of opening issues!

### RFCs (Request for Comments)

An RFC (request for comments) is a way of gathering broader discussion on a proposed change you would like to make. You
can open an RFC at any time by creating an issue, and selecting the "RFC" issue type.

For more information on the RFC lifecycle, please see ["Open source" in the Seequent Developer Portal.](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/open-source)

## Opening a pull request

We welcome all forms of pull requests, and strive to ensure contributions are reviewed and merged promptly.

Seequent requires that all commits are signed with verified signatures. Please ensure you configure commit signing
before creating a pull request. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification)
for more information.
